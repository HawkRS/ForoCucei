        Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this <br>
        shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I <br>
        can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much <br>
        shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.<br></p>

          <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
          The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the <br>
          tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the <br>
          weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of <br>
          lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those <br>
          who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord <br>
          when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
